# Identification of Gender and Person using Ear Images
Various bio-metric methods exist today to identify either the person or the features unique to him/her. Face recognition, fingerprint scanning, voice recognition are some of the present industry methods implemented for authentication. At bio-forensics level, verification through DNA sequencing is used for identification. In recent studies, it has been found that ear also play a role in providing identity to a person. We approach this problem by leveraging the power of deep learning. The images utilised for the above purpose are captured in an uncontrolled environment. Hence, making it's application possible at industry scalable level. We aim to determine the gender and person from the images of ear by applying Deep Learning Algorithms. We experimented both with scratch learning as well as fine tuning state of the art models.
